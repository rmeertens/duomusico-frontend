            <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
            <h3>How do you score songs?</h3>
            <p>Using an algorithm called TF-IDF. I first determined for each word in every lyric how "important" that word is for language understanding. If a word occurs very often (like the word: "me"), then it's not really interesting to server somebody a lyric with only that word a lot of times if he already knows more words</p>
            <h3>Do songs keep changing over time?</h3>    
            <p>Yes. Each time you learn more words the recommendations change. Make sure you check back often to get the latest recommendations for your level of knowledge!</p>
            <h3>Why doesn't this work for language X?</h3>
            <p>It's pretty difficult to find lists with lyrics in all languages. I added a lot of songs I know, but I don't know songs in all languages. If you happen to have a list of cool songs in a language I'm missing, please send it to me!</p>
            <h3>Do you make any money thanks to this site?</h3>
            <p>No, this site still standing after a research project. As it's pretty cool I never took it down. I don't have any advertisements or other ways of monetizing this site and I don't plan on that. In fact, I have to pay to keep it in the air. </p>
